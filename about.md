## EU CO2 Emissions Data

This Shiny App was created for searching and visualizing vehicle data from EU member states from 2010 to 2014.

The original dataset can be downloaded and metadata can be found at the [European Environment Agency](http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/co2-cars-emission-9) website.

Due to the shinyapps.io dataset size limit, this app currently works with a small sample from the full dataset (which is a ~130MB, ~2mi lines CSV file).

The source code for this Shiny App and for the data extraction/sampling process is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/fpmcardoso/data-products).
