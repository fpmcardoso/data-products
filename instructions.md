## Using this app

### Filtering the data

You can use the menu on the left to filter the data by using the sliders to change the period and the average CO2 emissions, or selecting specific countries or manufacturers.

The filters have global impact: once set, they are applied to all visualizations and to the tabular data.

You can also select all or clear all the checkboxes.

### Searching the raw data

Use the search box to find specific rows within the data in the Raw Data tab.
Example: try searching for "polo".

### Visualizations

You can navigate through the *Countries* and *Manufacturers* tabs to find visualizations on those topics.
On the *Other Visualizations* tab you can find how the average CO2 vehicle emission levels change with time and vehicle mass.
